### Optimal Control Homework Solutions – CMU 16-745
https://optimalcontrol.ri.cmu.edu/
## Introduction
This folder contains my personal solutions and notes for various homework problems based on Carnegie Mellon University’s course 16-745: Optimal Control.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a study log and reference point as I work through the problems. Some of the work may appear a bit scattered and condensed, but it provides insights to how I explored the advanced topics of optimal control.
