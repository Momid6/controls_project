# Controls Applications: Spacecraft Docking, Cartpole, and Quadruped

## Overview
This repository contains my **partial implementations** of several optimal control algorithms for real-life applications, based on the theory and examples from [Optimal Control for Robot Manipulation and Locomotion](https://optimalcontrol.ri.cmu.edu/).

## Credit
The full credit for the algorithm, structure, and original implementation belongs to:
[Optimal Control for Robot Manipulation and Locomotion](https://optimalcontrol.ri.cmu.edu/).

The code in this repository borrows structure and components from the courseâ€™s provided materials.  
I have only:
- Implemented selected functions/algorithms that were a part of tasks in the homework to reinforce my understanding of the theory.
- Modified or trimmed sections to suit my study purposes.
